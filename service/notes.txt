Service Discovery:
    When a clusterIP service is created, it gets a DNS of form "<service-name>.<namespace-name>.svc.clster.local". CoreDNS is responsible for creating the DNS record, 
    and the value of the DNS record is the actual clusterIP itself.

    This is just a virtual IP i.e. no actual network interface for this IP is created, instead just a dummy value to say traffic is hitting this service.

    When a service is created, and the underlying pods (to which requests need to be sent) are found using selectors, these are added to the endpoint slice for that service.

    so endpoint slice always have a list of all healthy pods to which traffic can be sent for that service.

    kube-proxy running in every node watches the api service for service related API calls, and after everytime a service is created, updated, etc; the iptables or internal 
    route tables of the node  so that request to any of the service can be intercepted and the destination Ip can be changed to one of the service-B's pod IPs (DNAT) 
    (service cluster IP and values as the pods IPs gathered from the endpoint slice).

    So lets say, a request from service A, calls service B, both in different nodes, coreDNS resolves the service DNS to the clusterIP, and kube-proxy uses the clusterIP and 
    in node-A checks for all list of available IPs to which the request can be sent, and modify the destination IP in the actual DNS itself (with one of the corresponding service-B's 
    pod IP address) --> DNAT [ DYNAMIC NETWORK ADDRESS TRANSLATION ] and then accordingly the request will be sent to the one of the pod of service B, via the CNI Network.

Apart from updating the IP tables after every service related operation from the API server, kube-proxy also syncs the IPs every 30 sec, so that anything that might be missed
are added to the iptables accordingly.

AWS VPC CNI -- Plugin to add when creating the cluster, so that this is responsible for assigning an IP to each and every pod created from the cluster (from the cluster CIDR)
