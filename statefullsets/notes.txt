> It is always used, when the application needs to maintain state (i.e, the request coming to the pod, should only be handled by the pod)

There should be persistent volumes attached to the pod. (mandatory)
Naming of pods will be sequential,

scale out and scale in pods will also be sequential

if pods are deleted, the pv won't be deleted (so that when the pod is created back, it gets assigned to the same pv)
