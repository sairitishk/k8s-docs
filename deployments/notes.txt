> Replica set is only responsible for maintaining the number of pod replicas based on labels.
    (if there are pods already running with the same labels, then those pods are also choosen by the replicaset to mantain the total number of running pods.)

    https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/replicaset/#non-template-pod-acquisitions

    [ TO CHECK: if pods are already running with label and replica set is created later, then does the previous pods have controller flag set to true?]

> To update image of pods in replicaset, need to update replicaset.yml file with new image and delete existing pods, then new pods that are created 
(in order to maintain the total number of replicas) will have the new image

> Deployments, if image is updated, new pods are automatically replaced.
also we can set the deployment strategry as per our needs, whether rolling update or others.

Replicaset vs Replication controller


Main difference: in replication controller (old version), only select pods (selector field) using single key value pairs.
                 But in replica set, we can use matchLabels and matchExpressions.

Other difference is that, replication controller manages only those pods that it creates (even if there are pods previously with same labels).
But this is not the same with replicaset.
