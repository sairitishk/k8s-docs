We cannot use network policies with VPC CNI in an EKS cluster, since there is no support.


For this, we need to use calico or cilium CNI plugin, only then the network policies will be in effect.

In most common cases, these are assigned to namespaces, so that we can control traffic flow between services in different ns.

This is similar to definining security groups to the ecs tasks (only allow traffic from a set of IPs on particular ports, and smlly for egress as well)
